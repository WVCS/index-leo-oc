    <h1> SPACE IS WEIRD </h1>
    <p> Space is huge. Picture how big you think space is, then multiply that by a million and it's still bigger than that. It's also actively growing bigger, the stuff that's far away from us is only getting further. </p>

    <p> It's also full of stuff, stuff that's unfathomably big to us, but absolutely miniscule on a galactic scale. Galaxies full of stars with orbiting planets millions of light-years away, not just difficult to see with detail but even more difficult to communicate with. </p>

    <h1> LIGHT IS WEIRD </h1>
    <p> Light has a maximum speed, around 299,792,458 metres per second. For us down on earth, it's not that big of a deal, we can see stuff just fine on our scale, but it starts to get hazy when it comes to space travel and communication. </p>

    <p> When something is described as being "x lightyears away," it means that the light we're seeing emitting/reflected off of the object is x years old. An alien species 300 million lightyears away looking at earth would see Pangaea, and if we looked back at them we would see their ancient version of their exoplanet. </p>

    <h1> LIFE IS WEIRD </h1>
    <p> Humans as a civilization have really only existed for 10,000 years or so. Even on the scale of Earth, that isn't that long. Billions of years worth of evolution led into the modern human as we know it, actual intelligence took a very long time to develop. </p>

      <p> In the terms of the entire universe, we occupy an incredibly small slice of what life can look like. In a world full of carbon-based tetrapods, we can barely even conceive of what a seperate planet full of actual alien creatures may look like. Maybe the way we developed was the most efficient for entropy, so all life has formed along a similar path of least resistance. Or maybe we were the lucky ones, and the rest of the universe is somewhat similar and we're the odd ones out. </p>

    <h1> HUMANS ARE WEIRD </h1>
    <p> You might hear people say stuff like, "We've been broadcasting into space for decades, how come we haven't heard anything back yet?" In the history of radio signal and space exploration, it seems like we've been nonstop broadcasting to deep space for as long as we could've, but in reality it's quite the opposite.</p> <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/The_Sounds_of_Earth_Record_Cover_-_GPN-2000-001978.jpg/1024px-The_Sounds_of_Earth_Record_Cover_-_GPN-2000-001978.jpg>
      <p> According to Wikipedia, there have been a total of only 12 major radio signals sent into space, many of those only being realized within the past 20 years. </p>

        <p> Most of the funding spent on finding extraterrestrial life has been spent on equipment for receiving signals, rather than broadcasting them. </p>
